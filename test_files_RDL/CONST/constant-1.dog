# ----- NUMBER -----
let a = 10
let b = 3

say "a = " + a
say "b = " + b

say "a + b = " + (a + b)
say "a - b = " + (a - b)
say "a * b = " + (a * b)
say "a / b = " + (a / b)

# re-assign (without let is also allowed)
a = a + 5
say "a after a = a + 5 -> " + a

# math module calls + constants
let root = math.sqrt(144)
say "sqrt(144) = " + root

let p = math.pow(2, 8)
say "pow(2, 8) = " + p

say "math.PI = " + math.PI
say "math.E  = " + math.E

# ----- STRING -----
let name = "Tuffy Rej"
let lang = "DPL"

say "name = " + name
say "lang = " + lang

# string + string
let title = name + " builds " + lang
say title

# string + number (auto printable() conversion)
let score = 99
say "score = " + score

# ----- BOOL -----
let ok = true
let fail = false

say "ok = " + ok
say "fail = " + fail

# IMPORTANT: right now you can store and print bool,
# but you cannot do arithmetic with bool (ok + 1 is not allowed).

# ----- NIL -----
let empty = nil
say "empty = " + empty

# nil can be stored and printed too,
# but arithmetic/operations with nil are not supported yet.

# ----- Variable overwrite between types (allowed) -----
let x = 5
say "x = " + x

x = "now I'm a string"
say "x = " + x

x = true
say "x = " + x

x = nil
say "x = " + x

# ----- io module usage (function calls) -----
io.println("Printed via io.println()")
io.print("Same line -> ")
io.println("done!")

# ----- using variables in calls -----
let n = 9
io.println("sqrt(" + n + ") = " + math.sqrt(n))

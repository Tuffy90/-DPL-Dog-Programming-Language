# Security Policy

Thank you for caring about the security of this project. Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly — report them privately using the channels below.

## How to report a security vulnerability

Please send reports by email to: pixeleforge@gmail.com

PGP is optional — if you prefer to send an encrypted report, you may ask for our public key and we will provide it. However, encrypted messages are not required.

If you cannot use email, please open a confidential issue in this repository (or otherwise contact us via the GitHub profile).

## What to include in your report

When possible, include:

- A short description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Example code, logs, or screenshots.
- Version information (tag/commit SHA) and environment (OS, JDK version, etc.).
- Any suggested fixes or mitigation steps, if available.

## Supported versions

We support the following branches/versions:

- main / v0.1.0 and newer — actively supported
- v0.x — maintenance only (critical fixes may be provided)
- Older releases — no longer supported (no security fixes)

Suggested Java support policy (adjust as needed):

- Supported JDKs: Java 11 (LTS), Java 17 (LTS)
- Minimum tested: Java 8 (if you still support it), otherwise indicate not supported

## Handling process

- Acknowledgement of receipt: within 48 hours.
- Initial response with plan / assessment: within 7 business days.
- Ongoing updates as a fix is developed.
- Public disclosure will be coordinated and normally occurs after a fix is released.

## Confidentiality

Please do not publish vulnerability details until a fix is available. We are open to coordinated disclosure and can agree on a timeline where appropriate.

## Emergency contact

If the vulnerability is critical and requires immediate attention, indicate this clearly in your subject line — we will prioritize accordingly.
